All help is welcome!

## Code Quality
We try to keep the code clean and readable. As such, we have an ESlint configuration file, `.eslintrc.json`, that you should use. Submitted Pull Requests will also get automatically checked using Continuous Integration, which will fail if new issues are created, or if duplicated code or function complexity increases by too much.
